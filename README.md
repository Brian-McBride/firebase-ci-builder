# firebase-custom-builder

Docker image for projects needing to run Firebase CLI, `npm` and Firebase emulation (which requires Java).

**Provides**

- `firebase-tools` & emulators (*)
  - OpenJDK 11
- `npm` and node.js 14

(*) These emulators are pre-fetched: `database`, `firestore`, `pubsub`.

**Other images**

There are [many images](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=firebase&type=image) for Firebase in Docker Hub but they seem to be made for personal use, and don't e.g. track tooling upgrades. They may also sport some project specific libraries which makes them unsuitable as a base image. The idea is to gather that momentum together so if you have your own, please consider using this instead for a stronger Firebase testing community.

- Community [Firebase image](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/firebase)

  Is left behind. 
  
  The info that there's emulation (that requires Java) has not reached it, yet. There is an [issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/issues/441) raised but no PR. Pushing this code to the community repo would be the right thing to do but feels like too much friction for the author.

- [`timbru31/docker-java-node`](https://github.com/timbru31/docker-java-node)
 
  This repo is mentioned as a foundation having both Java and Node. However, the author faced problems building it (23-Mar-21). Being based on "Azul" OpenJDK image wasn't reaffirming for general use, either. 

  The repo takes a JDK/JRE base image and installs Node on top of it. This repo does the opposite: takes a Node base image and installs Java on top of that.

Publishing Docker images may be costly (you are charged by the downloads, and images are big), so the approach taken here is that you build the image on your own, and push it to a private repo that *your* projects use.

This certainly works for the author.


## Requirements

- Docker
- Gnu `make`
- `gcloud` CLI

Recommended (optional):

- [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) - "A tool for exploring each layer in a docker image"

### Configure Docker

>Before you can push or pull images, you must configure Docker to use the gcloud command-line tool to authenticate requests to Container Registry.<sub>[source](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/quickstart)</sub>

```
$ gcloud auth configure-docker
```

## Build the image locally

You can do this simply to see that the build succeeds.

```
$ make build
...
Successfully built 29a6e8655e16
```

It should result in an image of ~679 MB in size, containing:

- JDK
- `firebase` CLI
- `npm` and node.js
- Emulator images in `.cache/firebase/emulators/`

You can check the size by:

```
$ docker image ls firebase-custom-builder:9.6.0-node14
REPOSITORY                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
firebase-custom-builder   9.6.0-node14        6e84ee9f7a74        3 hours ago         679MB
```


## Push to...

### Container Registry (Google Cloud)

Check that there is a suitable GCP project:

```
$ gcloud config get-value project 2>/dev/null
some-230321
```

Decide, which domain you wish to push the image to.

This should ideally be close to where your builds happen. See GCR > [Pushing and pulling](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling).

Prefix the command then with `_GCR_IO=[asia|eu|us].gcr.io`, according to your needs.

*tbd. We could also interactively ask this. One day..*

```
$ _GCR_IO=eu.gcr.io make push
docker build --build-arg FIREBASE_VERSION=9.6.0 . -t firebase-custom-builder:9.6.0-node14
...
Successfully built 6e84ee9f7a74
Successfully tagged firebase-custom-builder:9.6.0-node14
docker tag firebase-custom-builder:9.6.0-node14 gcr.io/groundlevel-160221/firebase-custom-builder:9.6.0-node14
docker push gcr.io/groundlevel-160221/firebase-custom-builder:9.6.0-node14
The push refers to repository [gcr.io/groundlevel-160221/firebase-custom-builder]

```

### Pushing `latest`

The above instructions (and the `Makefile`) only push a *tagged* image. 

If you want, you can also push one with tag `latest`. This allows your users to get a default version.

```
$ PROJECT_ID=..fill in..
$ docker tag firebase-custom-builder:9.6.0-node14 eu.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/firebase-custom-builder:latest
$ docker push eu.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/firebase-custom-builder:latest
The push refers to repository [eu.gcr.io/groundlevel-160221/firebase-custom-builder]
8962ccd62f6e: Layer already exists 
e53a3c030bdb: Layer already exists 
b05570e678df: Layer already exists 
1952ae150c4a: Layer already exists 
aedafbecb0b3: Layer already exists 
db809908a198: Layer already exists 
1b235e8e7bda: Layer already exists 
3e207b409db3: Layer already exists 
latest: digest: sha256:8344e59785e1a74eaf00708fdb8522bb098beec7f440f407abcfc601d2e4d6b4 size: 2003
```

## Using the image

You can now use the image eg. in Cloud Build as:

```
eu.gcr.io/<your-project-id>/firebase-custom-builder:9.6.0-node14
```

If you pushed the `latest` tag, you can leave out the tag at the end:

```
eu.gcr.io/<your-project-id>/firebase-custom-builder
```
