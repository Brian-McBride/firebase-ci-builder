#
# Dockerfile for Firebase CI testing
#
# Provides:
#   - 'firebase' CLI tools
#   - emulators
#   - node.js and npm
#
# Note:
#   Cloud Build (beta 2021.03.19) seems to strongly prefer that the builder image has root as its user; not a dedicated
#   user! Otherwise, one gets all kinds of access right errors with '/builders/home/.npm' and related files.
#
#   There is no damage or risk, leaving the builder image with root, so the user/home related lines have been
#   permanently disabled by '#|' prefix.

#|# It should not matter where the home is, but based on an error received with Cloud Build (beta 2021.03.19),
#|# the commands it excercises seem to expect to be able to 'mkdir' a folder within '/builder/home'.

#|ENV HOME /builder/home
#|ENV USER user
#|ENV GROUP mygroup

#   pubsub-emulator-0.1.0.zip
#
# = note that Firestore, Firebase emulators don't uncompress but PubSub does (and is distributed as a zip).
#   To see whether we can reduce the image size, one could uncompress those and remove the '.jar' files. #later????

#|# Now changing to user (no more root)
#|USER ${USER}
#|   # $ whoami
#|   # user

#|# Create '${HOME}/.npm' (as a user); trying to avoid access errors with Cloud Build.
#|#
#|RUN mkdir ${HOME}/.npm

# Don't define an 'ENTRYPOINT' since we provide multiple ('firebase', 'npm'). Cloud Build scripts can choose one.
