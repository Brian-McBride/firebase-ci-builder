## `fsevents@2.3.2` in the build

Installing `firebase-tools` (9.16.0):

```
#7 18.74 info fsevents@2.3.2: The platform "linux" is incompatible with this module.
#7 18.74 info "fsevents@2.3.2" is an optional dependency and failed compatibility check. Excluding it from installation.
```

This is likely normal.
